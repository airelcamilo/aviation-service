# Aviation Service

An **Aviation Data Platform** built with **Go**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Redis**, designed to collect airport information from [AviationAPI](https://www.aviationapi.com/) and provide offline access when the external API is unavailable.  
It also fetches **current weather data** from [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/).

---

## üöÄ Features

- Collect and cache **airport data** from AviationAPI  
- Store airport information in **PostgreSQL** for offline use  
- Retrieve **real-time weather data** for airports  
- CRUD operations for airport records  
- Synchronize incomplete airport data (`status = "PENDING"`)  
- API caching with **Redis**  
- Automated **background sync scheduler**

## üß† Data Flow Overview

1. Client requests airport data<br>
‚Üí Service first checks Redis cache.<br>
‚Üí If not found, queries PostgreSQL.<br>
‚Üí If still not found, fetches from AviationAPI and stores in both cache + database.

2. Weather requests<br>
‚Üí Directly calls WeatherAPI, cached for short-term reuse.

3. Scheduler<br>
‚Üí Periodically syncs airports with status = `"PENDING"` from the Aviation API.

## üß™ Testing Tips

1. Run unit tests with coverage:
```bash
go test ./internal/... -cover
```
2. Generate a detailed coverage report:
```bash
go test ./internal/... -coverprofile="coverage.out"
```
3. Visualize test coverage in your browser:
```bash
go tool cover -html="coverage.out"
```
